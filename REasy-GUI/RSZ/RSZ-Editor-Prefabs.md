# Prefabs

## Prefabs in RSZ Files

- Prefabs are used in files **scn**. They are references to PFB files or embedded PFBs.
- A prefab reference is a string that always ends with `.pfb`.
- The referenced prefab defines the configuration/structure and some default values for the GameObject being instantiated.

See [Associate a Prefab to the GameObject (or Modify Existing Prefab Path)](RSZ-Editor-GameObjects.md#associate-a-prefab-to-the-gameobject-or-modify-existing-prefab-path) for details on how to link prefabs to GameObjects.
